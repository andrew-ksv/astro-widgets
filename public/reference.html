        <h1>Astronomical Data Reference and Explanations</h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Planetary K-index</h2>
        <p>Planetary K-index shows the level of Earth’s geomagnetic activity.
        Values range from 0 to 9: the higher the number, the stronger the magnetic storm.</p>
        <p>This index is important for understanding space weather effects, such as:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>🔷 Disruptions in satellite communications and GPS signals</li>
                <li>🔷 Increased risk for power grid disturbances in high-latitude regions</li>
                <li>🔷 Enhanced visibility of auroras (Northern and Southern Lights) at lower latitudes</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2 class="subtitle">Auroras</h2>
        <p>Auroras, also known as polar lights, are natural light displays predominantly
            seen in high-latitude regions near the Arctic and Antarctic. In the Northern Hemisphere,
            they are often called Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights), while in the Southern Hemisphere
            they are referred to as Aurora Australis (Southern Lights).</p>
        <p>Auroras occur when charged particles from the Sun, mainly electrons and protons,
            collide with Earth's magnetic field and upper atmosphere. These particles excite the gases
            in the atmosphere - mostly oxygen and nitrogen - which then emit visible light. The colors of the
            aurora depend on which gases are involved and their altitude:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>🔷 Green – the most common, from oxygen at lower altitudes (~100 km).</li>
                <li>🔷 Red – oxygen at higher altitudes (~200-300 km).</li>
                <li>🔷 Purple and blue – nitrogen at lower altitudes.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>The Planetary K-index directly affects the visibility of auroras.
            When geomagnetic activity is low, auroras are faint and usually limited to polar regions.
            As geomagnetic activity increases, auroras become brighter, more dynamic, and can be observed
            farther from the poles. During strong geomagnetic storms (K-index 5-9), auroras may be visible at much lower
            latitudes than usual.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Sun & Moon Information</h2>
        <p>The Sun and Moon widgets display sunrise and sunset times, as well as moonrise,
            moonset, and moon illumination percentage, based on the selected location.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>🔷 Location selection determines the geographic coordinates used for calculations.
                    Sunrise and sunset times vary depending on latitude, longitude, and the current date.</li>
                <li>🔷 Sunrise / Sunset indicate the moments when the upper edge of the Sun crosses the horizon.</li>
                <li>🔷 Moonrise is the time when the Moon appears above the local horizon and becomes visible in the sky,
                    while Moonset is the time when it passes below the horizon and is no longer visible.</li>
                <li>🔷 Moon illumination (%) shows how much of the Moon’s visible surface is illuminated by the Sun.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>These values are useful for daily planning, astronomical observations,
            and understanding how sunlight and moonlight change throughout the day.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Space Weather Alert</h2>
        <p>The Space Weather Alert widget provides warnings about upcoming or ongoing geomagnetic disturbances,
            based on data from NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).</p>
        <p>This widget helps users quickly assess space weather risks, aurora visibility,
            and potential impacts on technology during geomagnetic events.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Astro Gallery</h2>
        <p>Astro Gallery is a visual feed of random astronomical images, refreshed hourly.
            The gallery presents a stream-like layout, similar to a social media feed, showcasing
            captivating photos of space. Each image includes a detailed description, providing
            context about what is shown - such as planets, nebulae, galaxies, the Sun, the Moon,
            or astronomical events - along with scientific or observational details.</p>
